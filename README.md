# FPKM
This repository contains the code for FPKM value calculation.

There will be few virson of codes which are developed step by step to calculate the FPKM value from the sequenceing data.
The virson 3 program is fully automated. The user only need to include the input file location and the output file location.
The program will automatically do the rest of the jobs creating a folder itself. All the produced result will be saved in that folder.
